<H2>Playable Xbox Demos</H2>

<BR>

<P><B>Why Do Demos?</B></P>
<P>Playable game demos not only give consumers an opportunity to play the game firsthand, but they also work as an invaluable marketing and PR tool. To that end, playable and non-playable demos should be an integral part of any marketing/PR plan.</P>

<P>It is vitally important that publishers make developers aware of the need for a demo as early in the development process as possible. Publishers should make sure developers also understand the importance of this process and that it ultimately means better sales figures, and subsequently, more developer royalties.</P>

<P>By preparing demos, movies, and so on to coincide with editorial coverage and ad campaigns, you can make a huge impression on gamers and really show them what your game is all about.</P>

<P><B>Demo Opportunities</B></P>
<P>Currently, two main venues exist for the distribution of your game demos: the Official Xbox Magazine (OXM) and the Xbox Interactive Retail Kiosks. Details of these opportunities for game distribution are in the documents below. To learn more about the OXM, contact David Rees (<A href="mailto:drees@imaginemedia.com"><B>drees@imaginemedia.com</B></A>) at Imagine Media to obtain their submission guidelines and schedule. By following the technical guidelines presented here, your developers will be able to create demos that will work for either the kiosks or the OXM.</P>

<P><B>Testing in a Launcher</B></P>
<P>It is important that you test your demo within a launcher that follows the same format as the kiosk and OXM launchers. To make this possible, the Xbox Xdemos Launcher has been provided below. Included in the file is a utility to create a script file (called an XDI file) for the launcher that allows it to call your demo. Usage instructions are also included. </P>

<P><B>Certification</B></P>
It is important to realize that all demos must go through certification, just like the full game will. The TCRs for demos are included in the <a href="/BPProgInfo.asp?Page=content/pub_guide_info.htm" title="Xbox Guide"><B>Xbox Guide</B></a> and are essentially the same as those for full titles, with the exception that demos are limited in what they are allowed to do. Please read and follow all the TCRs carefully. As always, you will need to coordinate with your account manager to schedule a certification date for your demo. Demos must be submitted to certification on DLT-IV tape and accompanied by a submission form following the requirements for a full product. To facilitate testing, all demos must be submitted with the launcher already set up to run the demo. Certification takes time; make sure you submit demos well in advance of the drop-dead date for a specific disc.</P>

<P><B>Usability</B></P>
<P>It is recommended that all Xbox interactive game demos adhere to the usability guidelines below. While these are not mandatory, they will lead to a more consistent and enjoyable experience for the consumer.</P>
