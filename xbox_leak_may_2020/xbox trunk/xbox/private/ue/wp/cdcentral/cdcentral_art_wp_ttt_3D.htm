<H2>Beyond Bumps</H2>

<P><I>Dave McCoy, , Xbox Content and Design Team</I></P>

<P>The per-pixel shading abilities on the Xbox™ video game console from Microsoft allow for very high quality bump maps. Bump maps actually are normal maps. Each pixel in the map corresponds to the normal to be used by the surface at that location, allowing simulation of much more than small bumps and surface variations. Some 3-D software packages allow normal maps to be exported directly from a rendering, but many don't, and usually, normal maps are created from elevation maps made by painting gray-scale images. Programmers then interpret the gray-scale information as height and create normal maps to be used by the Xbox.</P>

<P>To get artists to consider creating the more dimensional effects possible on Xbox with normal maps, I suggest that artists sometimes consider starting not with Photoshop, but with their favorite 3-D modeling package. Some types of dimensional surfaces are very difficult to create from scratch with paint.</P>

<P>In the example shown, I've started with the ubiquitous Beethoven model, but you may apply this technique with the classical composer of your choice. :^)</P>

<IMG src="/content/img/3DtoBump1.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="225" HSPACE="40" BORDER="0" ALT="">
 
<P>Paint a continuous black-to-white ramp image to apply to the model. Be sure to make the ramp at least 256 pixels along the axis of the fade and avoid using any dither. </P>

<IMG src="/content/img/3DtoBump2.gif" WIDTH="332" HEIGHT="35" HSPACE="0" BORDER="0" ALT="">
 
<P>Because you will often want to use only part of the model's dimension for the map, add a large black and white region at each end of the fade so that you can change where the cutoff points are for the start and end of the gray-scale texture. </P>

<P>Now apply the texture to the model with the gray-scale ramp along the axis on which you wish to record depth in the bump map. Ludwig is shown below with the ramp texture applied.</P>

<IMG src="/content/img/3DtoBump3.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="225" HSPACE="40" BORDER="0" ALT="">
 
<P>Now render the model isometrically, making it fully luminous or using other renderer-specific methods to avoid any lighting effects. Be sure to turn off any dithering for the rendering. You should wind up with a gray-scale representation of the model's depth suitable for use as a bump map or further detailing in paint.</P>

<IMG src="/content/img/3DtoBump4.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="225" HSPACE="50" BORDER="0" ALT="">
 
<P>Here, the map above has been applied to a quad with a couple of lights providing illumination. The stepping effects visible as a slightly rough appearance result from artifacts created when converting the elevation data to normal data and could be eliminated by smoothing the normal data after conversion.</P>

<IMG src="/content/img/3DtoBump5.gif" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="225" HSPACE="50" BORDER="0" ALT="">
 
<P>Beyond allowing you to create bump maps that would be difficult to author with paint, this technique can be used to create gray scales from geometry for LOD stand-ins for distant models. Often, normal mapped quads can replace geometry on distant objects that need to respond to dynamic lighting. </P>
