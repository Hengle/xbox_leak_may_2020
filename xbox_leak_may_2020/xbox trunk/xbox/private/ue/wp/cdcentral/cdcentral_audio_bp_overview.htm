<H2>Best Practices for Xbox Audio Design: Overview </H2>

<P><I>By Scott Selfon, Audio Content Consultant, Xbox Content and Design Team</I></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT SIZE="-1">Microsoft Confidential</FONT></FONT></P>

<BR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>The primary purpose of the Best Practices for Xbox Audio Design document is to familiarize you with the process of developing and integrating audio content for the Xbox&#8482; video game console from Microsoft. This mission is too large to complete in a single paper, so the document is divided into several chapters, which are published over time. The intent is that the earlier chapters will help you get a good jump on developing content on your PC for Xbox, while later chapters and separate white papers will address more specific concerns that arise. This document presents an overview of the topics to be covered in each chapter.</P>

<P>If you would like to see a topic covered that isn't mentioned below, please e-mail <A href="mailto:content@xbox.com">content&#64;xbox.com</A>. Also contact this alias regarding specific audio issues, content development questions, and any general suggestions or requests.</P>

<H3>Chapter 1: Xbox Audio Libraries</H3>
<P>Xbox implements a platform-specific version of Microsoft&#174; DirectX&#174; 8.0 that is based on the PC implementation of DirectX 8.0 Audio (Microsoft&#174; DirectSound&#174; and Microsoft&#174; DirectMusic&#174;), software that may be familiar to you. This chapter will discuss the libraries that Xbox supports. Our goal is to help minimize difficulties in migrating from PC development to developing for Xbox.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered in Chapter 1:</P>
<UL>
<LI>DirectSound for Xbox 
<LI>Xbox Media Objects 
<LI>DirectMusic Libraries for Xbox 
</UL>

<H3>Chapter 2: Xbox Audio Content</H3>
<P>Just as Xbox supports a subset of Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; DirectX Audio libraries, so too is a subset of playable content supported on Xbox versus the PC version. This chapter discusses the content types supported in Xbox Title Libraries v1.0 as well as plans for future features. Again, the focus is to help you make the transition as smoothly as possible from PC to Xbox content.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered in Chapter 2:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Wave Formats and Use of Compression Schemes
<LI>Use of Multichannel Audio
<LI>Support for DirectMusic Segment Track Types 
<LI>Support for DirectMusic File Types
</UL>

<H3>Chapter 3: Xbox Audio Hardware</H3>
<P>This chapter points out the architecture and features of the Xbox Media Communications Processor (audio hardware) as well as how it interfaces with DirectX Audio libraries for Xbox. This chapter also addresses other audio considerations relating to hardware, including multichannel playback and rendering, use of the hard disk, and use of the game disc with regard to audio.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered in Chapter 3:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Xbox Media Communications Processor General Specifications (tentative)
<Li>End User Audio Configurations
<LI>Audio Applications for the Hard Disk
<LI>Game Disc Use for Audio Management
<LI>Memory and CPU Considerations
</UL>

<H3>Chapter 4: Introductory Guide to DirectMusic Producer for Xbox (DMPX)</H3>

<P>DirectMusic Producer is the audio authoring and content delivery tool for Xbox audio assets&#8212;wave files, DLS collections, linear sequences, and dynamic audio. This chapter will focus on using it in conjunction with your existing digital audio and sequencing software to author and audition content.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered in Chapter 4:</P>
<UL>
<LI>DirectMusic Producer for Xbox Features
<LI>Audio Console Application
<LI>Xbox Synthesizer
<LI>Xbox Experimenter
<LI>Using Prior Versions of DirectMusic Producer for Xbox Authoring
</UL>

<H3>Chapter 5: Xbox Audio Content Development Tools</H3>

<P>Xbox strives to be an artist-centric platform. To that end, a series of tools have been developed to aid content creators in creating and auditioning content. This chapter will present an overview of each.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered in Chapter 5:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Xbox ADPCM Codec and Encoder
<LI>Command-Line Xbox Tools
<LI>Effects Authoring Tools
<LI>Multichannel Authoring Tools
<LI>DirectMusic Producer for Xbox
<LI>Xbox Development Kit Audio Samples
</UL>

<H3>Chapter 6: Audio Performance and Memory Footprint Optimizations for Xbox</H3>

<P>Often, many subsystems are competing for the finite resources of a console's hardware. This chapter will cover ways to get the most bang for your buck, with special focus on using the unique features of the Xbox console itself to get big sounds out of a minimized resource footprint.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered in Chapter 6:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Minimizing File Size (DLS collections, styles, segments, and so on)
<LI>Minimizing Footprint (file organization, scene organization, and so on)
<LI>Wave Compression Do's and Don'ts 
<LI>Chaining DirectSound Buffers on Xbox 
<LI>Breakdown of Footprint Size for Actual Audio Components
<LI>Managing File Load and Unload Using Scripting
</UL>

<H3>Chapter 7: Mixing Audio for Xbox</H3>

<P>One of the goals of Xbox is to have standardized expected volume levels so that the user doesn’t have to adjust their speakers for every game they play. This chapter covers audio authoring and implementation levels, as well as an overview of how mixing is accomplished on the Xbox.</P>

<P>Topics to be covered:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Target Audio Levels on Xbox Versus Other Consumer Devices
<LI>Audio Levels in the Xbox Dashboard
<LI>Default Audio Levels
<LI>Manipulating Audio Levels in DirectMusic and DirectSound
<LI>Listening to Mixes in Various User Configurations
</UL>
