<H2>Overview: How to Work with Xbox PR</H2>
<P>Press releases and other publicity related to third parties, and to the Xbox™ video game console from Microsoft, should occur only when a signed Publisher License Agreement (PLA) exists between Microsoft and the third-party partner. Until a contract is signed, no publicity can be conducted for a product related to Xbox. However, once the PLA is signed, Xbox PR will encourage its third-party partners to let the media know what is exciting and unique about its Xbox-related product.</P>
<H3>Artwork</H3>
<P>Xbox PR requires that all screen shots distributed to the media on your game be taken on the Alpha 2 XDK (Xbox Development Kit) or subsequent versions of the XDK. The goal here is to only have screen shots in circulation that represent what the console is capable of producing, rather than screen shots taken from early development kits that produce inferior results. The Alpha 2 XDKs are being delivered to developers and publishers in the December 2000 and January 2001 time frame. Any artwork that is given to the media that is not actually a screen shot should be correctly identified as such. Rendered images can be created using any medium and sent to the media as a visual portrayal of the game, but it must be clearly stated that these are not actual screenshots.</P>
<H3>Press Releases</H3>
<P>All press releases mentioning the Xbox video game console must undergo a mandatory review and be approved by Xbox PR. See the attached Press Release Approval Process sheet for more details. Here are some additional suggestions/guidelines for your releases:
<UL>
<LI>In the case of peripheral and middleware partners, tailor the release to explain how your product will make Xbox perform better than any other console on the market.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>In the case of game software publishers, explain how the technologic innovations in Xbox make your game do things that were never before thought possible. Outline in your release what it is about Xbox that brings your game to life and creates such a rewarding experience for the user.</LI>
</UL></P>
<H3>Tracking Program</H3>
<P>Many of our third-party partners have said that they would appreciate having a central coordinator at Xbox PR that keeps a master schedule of upcoming events and press releases pertaining to Xbox. 
<UL>
<LI>Participation in this tracking program, whereby Microsoft would track your upcoming press releases and events, is not mandatory. However, it is encouraged so that we can avoid having a logjam of releases and/or events on the same day.</LI><P><P></P></P>
<LI>Our goal is to coordinate the PR for all Xbox titles and to recommend the best days to hold events, distribute news, and release product information to maximize coverage. This helps promote both the individual third-party games and the overall platform.</LI>
</UL></P>
<H2><A Name=Press>Press Release Approval Process</A></H2>
<P>Any press release discussing the Xbox video game console must be submitted to Xbox PR for approval.</P>
<H3>Steps for Approval</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Write release.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Check to see that Xbox is referred to correctly in the release by reviewing the <A HREF=#Guidelines><B>Style/Trademark Guidelines</B></A> in the following section.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Submit release for approval. E-mail it to <A HREF="mailto:xboxpr@xbox.com">xboxpr@xbox.com</A> at least two business days before desired distribution date and time.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Call a member of the Xbox PR team (see contact list below) to alert us that the release has been e-mailed. We will be checking our e-mail regularly, but it is possible that an e-mail could not get through and we would not see it, in which case it would need to be resent.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Representatives from the Xbox PR team review the press release and make any edits using Microsoft&#174; Word, with revision marks on.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Xbox PR e-mails press release back to third party within two business days of receiving the original document.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Third-party partner incorporates edits made by Xbox PR team.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>If the third-party partner wants to resubmit the release to Xbox PR with additional edits, add another business day into the timeline to account for this additional editing.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Final version of release must be sent back to <A HREF="mailto:xboxpr@xbox.com">xboxpr@xbox.com</A> before distribution.</LI>

<H3>Official Descriptor</H3>
<P>Use the official descriptor the first time Xbox is mentioned:
<UL>
<LI>the Xbox&#8482; video game console from Microsoft</LI>
<P class=note><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xbox trademarking is not needed in titles of press releases, just in the first mention of Xbox within the body of the release.</P></UL></P>
<H3>How to Refer to Xbox</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Please note the correct spelling of Xbox-a capital "X" followed by lower case "box," and it is all one word.</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>After first describing Xbox in the release as "the Xbox&#8482; video game console from Microsoft," it is acceptable to refer to the console as "Xbox."</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Avoid using Microsoft as a qualifier directly before the word Xbox, such as calling the console "Microsoft's Xbox."</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Avoid using Xbox in the possessive, such as "Xbox's technical specifications." Instead, say, "the technical specifications of Xbox."</LI><BR><BR>
<LI>Avoid using Xbox in the plural, such as "in the booth will be numerous Xboxes." Instead, say that, "in the booth will be numerous Xbox video game consoles."</LI>
</UL>
<H3>Microsoft's Legalese</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Xbox and Microsoft are trademarks of Microsoft Corp.</LI>
</UL>

</blockquote>
<H2><A Name=Quotable>Quotable Xbox Executives</A></H2>

If you would like to include a quote from one of these executives in your release, include it in the draft you submit, and Xbox PR will either approve, reject, or edit the quote.

<H2><A Name=Screen_Shot>How to Take a Screen Shot on an Alpha 2 XDK</A></H2>
<H3>Screen Shots for Xbox Games</H3>
<P>The Xbox system software will not support a system wide screen shot solution. We have provided an API that will allow developers to implement their own screen shot functionality in their title. To do this, you will need to add some code to your title as described below.</P>
<H3>Xbox Programmatic Screen Captures Under Xbox System Software</H3>
<P>One method of producing high-fidelity screen captures for Xbox games running under the Xbox system software is to incorporate the below code, and then copy the file onto a machine that will allow for file type/bit depth conversion. One can also use the below code as a basis for dumping a surface to another format, with modification of course. Questions or comments can be 
e-mailed to <A HREF="mailto:xboxds@xbox.com">xboxds@xbox.com</A>.
