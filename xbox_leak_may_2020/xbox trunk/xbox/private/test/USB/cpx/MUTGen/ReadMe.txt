
Using the MUExert Load generator:

The MU Traffic Generator is intended to produce a traffic load on the USB Bus in order to test load conditions.  It does this by constantly reading and writing a 2 MB file to each formatted MU in the system.

Since the purpose of this application is merely to generate load, the integrity of the data is not validated.

For reasons of memory allocation and to simplify screen display, testing is restricted to the first 3 game ports.

Reminder:  Formatted MUs only and only use the first 3 ports.
