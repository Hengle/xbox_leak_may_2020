This directory contains the rom images that have been released to Thomson for
various hardware builds of the dongle.

Each subdirectory is a version number and contains all of the images generated for that version.

These are copied as part of recovery for setting up the irrem.xbe test application.  irrem.xbe uses these
to verify that a download off the dongle was accurate.
