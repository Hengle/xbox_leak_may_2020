Memory Check is a test that will perform reads and
writes for every byte of memory that exists on the
Xbox.  If at any time the memory does not match its
expected value, a failure will be logged and the test
will continue on to the next block.

In order for this test to run properly, a few conditions
have to be met.

    1.) USB Must be disabled.  If you enabled USB during
        this test, memory can change out from under the
        test and a false failure can occur.

    2.) XBDM Must be disabled.  If XBDM is enabled it
        can cause the network adapter to manipulate 
        memory out from under the test and a false
        failure can occur.

    3.) Interrupts must be disabled.  This will prevent
        any other program or device from changing
        memory out from under the test.
