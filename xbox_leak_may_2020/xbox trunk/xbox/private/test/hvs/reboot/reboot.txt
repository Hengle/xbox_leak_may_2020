This test is used to verify media detection by rebooting
the xbox multiple times and checking the contents of
the dvd drive.

These are the settings and the type of reboot that 
happens:

        HalReturnToFirmware(HalRebootRoutine)

    RebootType=1 - Hard Reboot
        HalWriteSMBusByte(POWERCYCLE)
