Disk Read is a low level disk (hard drive and dvd)
scanning utility. The test attempts to read the sectors 
specified in the configuration, either with a call to 
NtReadFile (hard drive or dvd drive), or DeviceIoControl 
(dvd drive only).

Any errors reported by the device or the OS will be 
logged. Data can be verified by issuing two reads per 
address (use the NumberOfReads=2 setting).
