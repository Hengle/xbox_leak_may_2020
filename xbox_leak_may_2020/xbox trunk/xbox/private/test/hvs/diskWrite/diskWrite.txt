Disk Write is used to test IO on the hard disk. It has the
following test modes:

    1)  Low Level Scan - This test reads, writes, and then
        reads again from the sectors specified in the 
        configuration file. This test can be used to verify
        that IO is possible at every address.

    2)  Create Files - This test uses the filesystem to 
        create up to 2048 files of varying sizes (1 to 4k).
