Read File (readFile.xbe)

This test uses the filesystem to read every file on the 
disk (hard drive or dvd drive). The test parses the 
entire directory structure, reading the contents of every 
file found.

This test uses the same APIs a game invokes to read
from the disk. Because of the error handling inside the 
OS, we should never see an error from this test. If we 
see an error on a game disk, then that game will too.
