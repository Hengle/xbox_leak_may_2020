Direct3D sample program -- RearViewMirror
-----------------------------------------

* Purpose:
This sample demonstrates how to create a 'rear-view mirror' effect
using WinCE for DreamCast.  It displays a trench with a series of 
spinning cubes evenly spaced along its axis.  A mirror (of an arbitrary shape)
is positioned above and in front of the view, angled in such a way as to
reflect the scene behind the camera.  As the camera is moved along the trench 
it displays the cubes approaching from in front of the camera and falling away 
behind in the rear-view mirror.
