This document is intended to provide a list of changes to badman

o  Added /* and */ commenting tolerance in scripts
o  Got parser to recognize EndCase: keyword & modified structure to allow
   interpretation of it in the near future
o  Added APICLN.DLL to allow component owners to clean up after a test call
   to a given API.
o  Modified README.TXT to be in sync with above changes.

		5-7-92

o  Fixed the checking of return results for Good parameter testing so that
   they work correctly.
o  Added logging information for exceptions generated by API calls. They
   now return the same information as an invalid return value.
o  Added the option of considering an exception a success.  Note that when
   the -e flag is used to do this, it will ALSO be considered a success for
   valid parameter testing.
o  Added the '!=' value for function prototypes. Users will be able to say
   that the expected return value of a given API upon failure is anything
   EXCEPT a particular value.
o  Added a sum of documented/run test cases for the console printing.

o  Changed GenParm so that script entries with no good and/or bad values
   for a given parameter are treated correctly.
o  Inserted the -d option to generate a DebugBreak() shortly before a test
   call is made to the API being tested.

o  Implement '-z' which prints out the call/parameter set for all variations,
   instead of just failing ones.
o  Print the result of GetLastError in failure cases.
o  Make JohnMil fix the exception (-e) flag so that it only treats exceptions
   as successful cases if bad params were passed.
