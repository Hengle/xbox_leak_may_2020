**1. If a good parameter invocation of an API fails with either the expected
**   or unexpected return value, no error message is printed. RamC 3/20/92

|
|There is something strange happening with respect to the APIs
|generating an exception.
|
|When I invoke badman as
|
|badman acl.bms -y -g 
|
|the API GetAce generates an exception for variation 1 - all good params.
|
|But, if I invoke badman as
|
|badman acl.bms -y -g -a GetAce
|
|the exception is not generated.
|
|Why would this be?  This behavior is consistent and I remember
|seeing it while using another .bms file also.
|
|This doesn't seem very serious but could be a sign of some problem.
|
|thanks

I see the same behavior in my memory management tests. There is a bug open
against the rtlHeap routines, they seem to have problems with the amount
of allocation/deallocation that goes on in BadMan... It is entirely possible
the problem could be in BadMan, but since the problem was reported in extensive
rats tests as well, I'm going to wait for the resolution of the bug before
I investigate....

**3. Inability to detect if the API call succeeded/failed - Ramc 3/23/92

**|
**|The prototype for an API specifies FALSE as the return
**|value on failure.
**|
**|Now, I test an API for good parameters.  If the API call
**|succeeds you don't say anything - so, let us assume silence
**|means the call succeeded.  But, if the API call fails with
**|the expected return value - say FALSE in our example -
**|then also you don't say anything.  So, how can one know
**|if the API call succeeded/failed?
**|
**|The only way seems to be to write a validate routine and
**|check if the return value is FALSE.
**|
**|Any ideas?

**!!!!!!!!!! Sounds like a bug in BadMan to me.  I'll try and get it fixed
**in the next day or two, because it SHOULD be printing a messages saying
**that it failed in the case you detail below. Keep using badman!!! You're
**finding all the bugs so I can fix 'em :) thanks,
