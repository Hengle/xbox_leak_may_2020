Sli is a basic scripting engine with features to test usb stuff.

To use it, build:
Build Instructions:
test tools
ssync -r
cd slixbox\slixd
bcz
cd..
bcz

copy the resulting .xbe (\*bins\dump\slixbox.xbe) over to the xbox, run it.
plug in a duke poc to the xbox.

open net.txt, and change the name to your test computer's name.

After that is running, start sli30.exe (in this folder)
open the test script from sli30, and hit "go" (f5).
when the dialog box comes up, choose "2".

The test script is designed for the gold duke. It should theoretically
turn on the rumble moters to the speed that matchess how hard you press one
of the buttons on the control pad.

Xbox will just crash after a few milliseconds.
Sli will appear to crash. Leave it for a minute, and it will
eventually un-freeze. (when the send error dialog box comes up, click
Run : stop.)
