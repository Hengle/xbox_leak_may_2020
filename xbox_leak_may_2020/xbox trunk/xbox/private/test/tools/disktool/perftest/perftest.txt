this is a disk performance test

1.) to get valid results, it should only be run by itself

perf secnarios:
0.) states to be used:
	a.) with write-through enabled
	b.) with write-through disabled
1.) read / write files starting small and getting bigger
2.) read / write files starting big and getting smaller
3.) read / write files big files
3a.) read / write files big files using overlapped IO
4.) read / write files small files
3a.) read / write files small files using overlapped IO
5.) read / write files mixed big and small files
5a.) read / write files mixed big and small files using overlapped IO

other things:
1.) we want to catch any degradation that happens over time, so run times should be long - like an hour, and more if a steady state does not seem to be reached by then.
2.) we want single and multithreaded modes of all of these
3.) we want a spreadsheet and graphs for all scenarios, with build numbers
4.) these are in addition to the normal file IO tests that JPoley has written
