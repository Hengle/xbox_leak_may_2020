<TR>
<TD>10004</TD>
<TD>A blocking operation was interrupted by a call to WSACancelBlockingCall.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10013</TD>
<TD>An attempt was made to access a socket in a way forbidden by its access permissions.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10014</TD>
<TD>The system detected an invalid pointer address in attempting to use a pointer argument of a call.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10022</TD>
<TD>Some invalid argument was supplied.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10024</TD>
<TD>Too many open sockets. Each implementation may have a maximum number of socket handles available either globally per process or per thread.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10035</TD>
<TD>This error is returned from operations on non-blocking sockets that cannot be completed immediately.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10036</TD>
<TD>A blocking operation is currently executing.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10037</TD>
<TD>An operation was attempted on a non-blocking socket that already had an operation in progress.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10038</TD>
<TD>An operation was attempted on something that is not a socket.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10039</TD>
<TD>A required address was omitted from an operation on a socket.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10040</TD>
<TD>A message sent on a datagram socket was larger than the internal message buffer or some other network limit or the buffer used to receive a datagram into was smaller than the datagram itself.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10041</TD>
<TD>A protocol was specified in the socket function call that does not support the semantics of the socket type requested.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10042</TD>
<TD>An unknown invalid or unsupported option or level was specified in a getsockopt or setsockopt call.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10043</TD>
<TD>The requested protocol has not been configured into the system or no implementation for it exists.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10044</TD>
<TD>The support for the specified socket type does not exist in this address family.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10045</TD>
<TD>The attempted operation is not supported for the type of object referenced.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10046</TD>
<TD>The protocol family has not been configured into the system or no implementation for it exists.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10047</TD>
<TD>An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used. All sockets are created with an associated address family (i.e. AF_INET for Internet Protocols) and a generic protocol type (i.e. SOCK_STREAM).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10048</TD>
<TD>Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/IP address/port) is normally permitted.
<P><SPAN onMouseOver="ToolTip('Set the following registry key:<BR><B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip\\Parameters</B><BR>DWORD TcpTimedWaitDelay = 0x1E (30)<BR>To help reduce this error.',null,true);" CLASS=HOTSPOT>Help</SPAN>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10049</TD>
<TD>The requested address is not valid in its context. Normally results from an attempt to bind to an address that is not valid for the local machine or connect/sendto an address or port that is not valid for a remote machine.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10050</TD>
<TD>A socket operation encountered a dead network. This could indicate a serious failure of the network system (i.e. the protocol stack that the WinSock DLL runs over) the network interface or the local network itself.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10051</TD>
<TD>A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable network. This usually means the local software knows no route to reach the remote host.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10052</TD>
<TD>The host you were connected to crashed and rebooted. May also be returned by setsockopt if an attempt is made to set SO_KEEPALIVE on a connection that has already failed.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10053</TD>
<TD>An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine possibly due to a data transmission timeout or protocol error.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10054</TD>
<TD>A existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10055</TD>
<TD>An operation on a socket could not be performed because the system lacked sufficient buffer space or because a queue was full.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10056</TD>
<TD>A connect request was made on an already connected socket.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10057</TD>
<TD>A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket is not connected and (when sending on a datagram socket using sendto) no address was supplied. Any other type of operation might also return this error.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10058</TD>
<TD>A request to send or receive data was disallowed because the socket had already been shut down in that direction with a previous shutdown call.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10060</TD>
<TD>A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond.
<P><SPAN onMouseOver="ToolTip('To help reduce receive timeouts,<BR>call Surge.Engine\'s <A HREF=\'../Surge.Engine/m_SetReceiveTimeout.htm\'>SetReceiveTimeout</A>, or<BR>the scripts <A HREF=\'../ScriptLanguage/Commands/TIMEOUT.htm\'>TIMEOUT</A><BR>', null, true);" CLASS=HOTSPOT>Help</SPAN>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10061</TD>
<TD>No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10064</TD>
<TD>A socket operation failed because the destination host was down. A socket operation encountered a dead host. Networking activity on the local host has not been initiated.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10065</TD>
<TD>A socket operation was attempted to an unreachable host. See WSAENETUNREACH.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10067</TD>
<TD>A Windows Sockets implementation may have a limit on the number of applications that may use it simultaneously.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10091</TD>
<TD>This error is returned by WSAStartup if the Windows Sockets implementation cannot function at this time because the underlying system it uses to provide network services is currently unavailable.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10092</TD>
<TD>The current Windows Sockets implementation does not support the Windows Sockets specification version requested by the application.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10093</TD>
<TD>Either the application hasn’t called WSAStartup or WSAStartup failed.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10101</TD>
<TD>Returned by recv WSARecv to indicate the remote party has initiated a graceful shutdown sequence.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10104</TD>
<TD>A service provider returned a bogus proc table to WS2_32.DLL.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10105</TD>
<TD>A service provider returned a version number other than 2.0.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10106</TD>
<TD>Either a service provider's DLL could not be loaded (LoadLibrary failed) or the provider's WSPStartup/NSPStartup function failed.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>10107</TD>
<TD>Returned when a system call that should never fail does.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>11001</TD>
<TD>No such host is known. The name is not an official hostname or alias or it cannot be found in the database(s) being queried.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>11002</TD>
<TD>This is usually a temporary error during hostname resolution and means that the local server did not receive a response from an authoritative server. A retry at some time later may be successful.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>11003</TD>
<TD>This indicates some sort of non-recoverable error occurred during a database lookup.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>11004</TD>
<TD>The requested name is valid and was found in the database but it does not have the correct associated data being resolved for.</TD>
