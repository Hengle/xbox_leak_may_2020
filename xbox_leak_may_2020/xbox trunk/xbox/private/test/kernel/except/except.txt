this is a test for exception handling in kernel-mode code

1.) run through the various exceptions and make sure exception handling works
2.) may need to add stuff for MMX
3.) this is adapted/directly stolen from stuff I did on wx86
4.) except for some simple things like AV, don't need to worry about most integer faults since most o them have to do with protected mode violations, and we are in the kernel...
