DiskTest documentation for the hardware team

Here is what the hardware team wants:
2.3	Hard Disk Drive

The HDD software test applet will provide a method for measuring the following critical hard drive parameters:
-	Startup Time - from power on to Drive Ready  (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Startup Time - from Standby to Drive Ready  (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Spindown Time - from Standby Command  (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Spindown Time - from power off (we don't use power management, and not possible to time this from software)
-	Seek/Read Time (not compatible with the way the OS works)
-	Seek/Write Time (not compatible with the way the OS works)
*	Data Transfer Rate, Sustained (*can use existing filesystem tests)

-       Additionally the test tool will provide a mechanism for reading and writing data and files to any specified location on the hard disk. (nope!)

-The test applet will allow each HDD command to be sent in each of the following modes:
-	DMA MultiWord modes 0-3 (nope)
-	DMA-33 (nope)
-	PIO Modes 0-2 (nope)

+The Test applet will be able to support the SMART self-test features of the hard drive and report self test results.
        SMART test:
                SMART READ DATA
                SMART ENABLE/DISABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE
                SMART SAVE ATTRIBUTE VALUES
                SMART EXECUTE OFF-LINE IMMEDIATE
                SMART ENABLE OPERATIONS
                SMART DISABLE OPERATIONS
                SMART RETURN STATUS

Here is what they are going to get:
*        identify attached devices - done

*        SMART test - done

*        Full-Stroke Seek Time (inner track to outer track, and outer track to inner track combines) - done (may have to tweak when we get real hardware)
*        Track-to-Track Seek Time - inner tracks, middle tracks, outer tracks - done


Here is how it works:
The test enumerates all devices, and calls each test for each device.
If the device supports the commands required to perform the tests, 
it performs the test, otherwise it returns.
