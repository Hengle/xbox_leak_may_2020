Todo: 
- Add baseline file info for whether a member definition should exist.  Make sure you can't
  jump to it.
- Handle nested classes.
- Verify a class with no members, has no members.
- Localize strings used in uiwrkspc.cpp and classview.cpp.
- Handle the case where a project currently exists.  I could make it a SubSuite 
  cleanup, but I don't know if that's the best idea.
- Remove Sleep from search for Globals node.  A one second delay was added to
  work around bug #12747
