TEST WIZARD TROUBLE SHOOTING TIPS

This document contains tips for trouble shooting the most common Test Wizard Problems.

*************** USING TEST WIZARD  **************

PROBLEM: "Project Type" drop down does not list TESTWIZ.DLL

SOLUTION: Make sure TESTWIZ.DLL is placed in the APPWIZ directory which is under the IDE's BIN directory. You should have something like this:
C:\IDE\BIN\APPWIZ\TESTWIZ.DLL
		  APIDATA.TXT

*If you don't have an APPWIZ directory create one.

PROBLEM:Running Test wizard asserts or crashes before the first dialog is shown.

SOLUTION 1: Make sure the binaries that live in IDE\BIN are debug. The retail version of the IDE can't load testwiz.dll.  
Soon a new retail version of testwiz.dll  will be checked in that will work with the release IDE.

SOLUTION 2: Your MFCAPPWZ.DLL in the IDE\BIN directory may be out of sync.  If ssyncing to the latest does not fix the problem please let EnriqueP know so he can update TESTWIZ.DLL.


PROBLEM: "Can't Open API document file" alert comes up.

SOLUTION: Make sure APIDATA.TXT is placed in IDE\BIN\APPWIZ.

PROBLEM: The Scripts Dialog displays bogus data in its listboxes.

SOLUTION: Verify the APIDATA.TXT has valid data and the data is written in a valid format. See CUSTAPI.TXT for a brief explanation of the format.

****** BUILDING TEST WIZARD GENERATED TESTS **********

PROBLEM: Compiler errors "Can't find *.h or *.cpp file"

SOLUTION: Use the Tools.Options.Directories dialog to add all the CAFE include files:
C:\CAFE\CAFE\SRC
C:\CAFE\CAFE\INC
C:\CAFE\CAFE\WB
C:\CAFE\CAFE\WB\SYM

*Also make sure you have the MFC include paths correct.

PROBLEM: Linker errors "Can't find *.lib"

SOLUTION 1: Use the Tools.Options.Directories dialog to add all the CAFE libs : 
C:\CAFE\CAFE\LIB\X86
		 ALPHA
		 MIPS

SOLUTION 2: Make sure your CAFE libs are built and up to date. If they need rebuilding run NMAKE from the \CAFE\CAFE\SRC directory.  Use the switch DEBUG=1 (or =0) depending on the type of libs you need.
Also create the WB lib by running NMAKE from \CAFE\CAFE\WB


PROBLEM: Other Compiler errors such as "undeclared symbol".

SOLUTION: If you added API's while using the test wizard, it is possible that you might need to declare variables for  API parameters or fix any typos you might have introduced.

**************  Executing the tests  *****************
You should be able to launch both V3 and V2 IDE versions for debug or retail versions.  Make sure your Workbench Info settings point to the correct IDE.
