A: It is a custom App Wizard extension DLL (AWX) that is used to create CAFE automated tests.

Q: Who needs this tool?
A: Anybody who wants to write a new CAFE test script.

Q: What advandages does Test Wizard have?
A: The start up time to create a new test is greatly reduced since it automatically generates a CAFE type makefile and all the necessary source files, hiding all of the grunge work so the user is able to focus on writing the test cases instead of worrying about the underlying support code. 
It also provides an intuitive UI to the CAFE member functions so that the user can get a headstart on writing the script.

A: This text file briefly explains how to install and use the Test Wizard.

Q: Who do I contact for support, bug reports or feature requests?
A: EnriqueP or IvanL

		 \apidata.txt (CAFE database)

To install the Test Wizard:

1. Copy both testwiz.awx and apidata.txt from the V3\TOOLS\BIN directory to V3DROP\BIN\IDE

 *If you are using the Debug IDE you must copy the testwizd.awx to IDE\BIN\IDED


**************  RUNNING TEST WIZARD  *********************

1. Start IDE; File.New; select New Project Workspace
2. Specify the name of your new test and the path to the new location.
3. Select "TestWizard Custom Appwiz" from 'Project Type' drop down; <Create>.
4. The next dialog is self explanatory.  
 To create an empty skeleton for your sniff test click "Finish"
OR
  You can click on  <Edit Script...> if you want to start writing your test.

5. After you are done reading the confirmation dialog hit "OK"

The test wizard will create a new project with all the correct Project settings and source and *.stf files. 
If you build this project you should get a working automation test dll .  

*** IMPORTANT: ****
Test Wizard gets its data from apidata.txt.  This text file will be periodically updated and checked in into
 \CAFE\V3\TOOLS\BIN   so remember to ssync and copy it to your local BIN\IDE (or BIN\IDED) directory.

Any feedback and bugs reports are welcome. Feel free to contact EnriqueP if you have any questions,

 Thanks and Happy coding!
