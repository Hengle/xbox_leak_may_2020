From Jay 10/16/00: Stop command causes access violation writing virtual address

[FIXED 10/16 -EG]From Jay 10/16/00: trying to check against a string with spaces generates error "failed with exception: invalid syntax"  this is necessary for checking certain items like debug bits.

From Jay 10/16/00: if there is a space after a value before , on run/start line (ie "count = 1 ,") there are errors about converting the value to integer. [my fault]

[DONE 10/23/00] From brad 10/18/00: Change ReportError() to return a bool; true indicates an abort signaled, false indicates no abort signaled.

[FIXED 10/23/00] From Jay 10/18/00: SetTimeoutLimit does not change the timeout from 30 seconds (the default).  

[FIXED 10/23/00] From Jay 10/18/00: using GetCfgInt on 0xffffffff does not return -1 (returns 2147483647)

[Feature -eg]From Jay 10/19/00: debugmask does not work as global statement, nor can you change a variable in the test flow twice.

[NEVER MIND, was not implemented yet]From Jay 10/20/00: using loop causes assertion failure.

From Jay 10/23/00: limit of 128 chars on line is no longer enforced.

[FIXED 10/23/00] From Jay 10/23/00: Divide by zero in release version causes hang.

From Jay 10/27/00: throw (0, NULL) results in assertion failure or access violation

From Jay 10/27/00: return value for converting to int is not checked on GetCfgInt

From Brad 12/20/00: CheckAbort() access time(NULL); experiments have shown that this causes a 2.5 ms delay.  Replace time(NULL) with GetTickCount()

[Not going to be fixed; this is intended behavior 1/25/01] From Brad 01/12/01: timelimit and debugmask are not inherited by the tests inside a loop.  For example, observe the following INI section:

	[testflow];-- This section must follow parameters section
	run loop, debugmask = 3, haltonerror = false, looplimit = 1, timelimit = 3600

	run CPU.feature_check
	end loop

	In this INI section, when CPU.feature_check runs, the defaults are applied to timelimit and debug mask
	(0 and 0 respectively).  Both of these should apply to every entry in the loop.

From Brad 1/25/01: maxtimeout can be set in an INI file at the loop level, but not at the test level (inside the loop)
