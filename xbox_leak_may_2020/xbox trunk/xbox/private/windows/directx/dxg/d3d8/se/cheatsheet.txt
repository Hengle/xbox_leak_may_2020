1. Look at hardware's pointers for the push buffer
        dd fd003240 l2  
    
   DW1=HW_PUT 
   DW2=HW_GET
   If they are equal, DMA pusher is idle.
   Dump out contents of the push buffer at: 80000000+HW_GET or 80000000+HW_PUT

2. Look at CACHE1 content pointers.  This is what the GPU is actually processing.
        dd fd003210 l1  -- CACHE1_PUT: Where the parser is adding stuff
        dd fd003270 l1  -- CACHE1_GET: Where the PGRAPH is picking up stuff
   Disable the pusher
        ed fd003220 0
   Disable the puller
        ed fd003250 0
   Calculate the address in cache as: fd003800+CACHE1_PUT*2
   Dump out DWORDs at the address.  The first DWORD is the method followed by data
    
   Dump out the CACHE1_GET contents the same way

   If CACHE1_PUT and CACHE1_GET are the same then everything is caught up
   
   Cache1 is 1K (128 method/data DWORD pairs).  It is located at fd003800 and shadowed at fd003c00.
   The Get pionter can actually point into the the shadow.

3. Dump out PGRAPH status
        dd fd400700 l1
    0 indicates graphics is idle, 1s indicate modules that are busy or hung

4. Dump out interrupts are pending.  Look at NV_PMC_INTR_0_* in nv_ref_2a.h to see meanings of the bits
        dd fd000100 l1

5. Dump out the address where the CRTC is scanning out of
        dd fd600800 l1

6. Dump out instance memory
        dd fd710000

7. Dump out FIFO status
        dd fd002100 l1
   A value of 00001000 means parse error

8. Debugging parse errors
        dd fd0032a0 l3
   DW1=How many bytes transfered before parse error
   DW2=Last data the parser saw
   DW3=Command being processed when the parse error occured
   
9. Disable interrupts
        ed fd600140 0   --- disable vblanks
        ed fd000140 0   --- disable all other interrutps
        
10. To tell if its a Micron memory system
        dd fd101000 l1   --- STRAP_VALUE
        ? STRAP_VALUE & c0000
    If the value is 0, its a Micron system
    
11. Dump out the current class
        dd fd40014c l1  -- 97 is kelvin
        
12. Dump out the internal PGRAPH fifo cache:

        dd fd4007a0 l8  -- 8 method DWORDs 
        
        dd fd4007c0 l8  -- corresponding 8 data DWORDS
        
    The contents of this cache should match up to the CACHE1_GET - 0x40.
    
13. Dump PGRAPH fifo status
        
        dd fd400720 l1
        
14. Dump the PMC

        dd fd000200 l1
        
15. Dump the D3D device object

        dd d3d__g_pdevice l1 
        dt D3D::CDevice <result>   
           
16. To dump out the current Begin/End state

        dd fd400F5C l1
        
    1=means we are inside a begin/end
