Need to talk about UMA support
        - Code snippets for building objects
        - How reference counts work with pre-built objects
        - How Get/SetPrivateData doesn't work (or does it?)
        - Alignment requirements
        - How cache has to be flushed for pre-built data (or DMAed in)
        
Talk about constant capabilities of driver (i.e., explain our D3DCAPS8 settings)
