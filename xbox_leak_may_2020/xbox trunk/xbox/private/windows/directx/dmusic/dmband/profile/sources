Module Name:

    sources.inc

Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

    This sources file builds the profile libraries, so it defines the PROFILE
    symbol, and it defines LIBEXT as 'i', which is the standard for profile
    non-debug libraries.


!ENDIF

LIBEXT=i
