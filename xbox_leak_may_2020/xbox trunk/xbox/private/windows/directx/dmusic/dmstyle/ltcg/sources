Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

    This sources file builds the link time code generation libraries. Note that
    link time code generation is incompatable with precompiled headers, which
    is why all the PRECOMPILED_XXX symbols are set to empty after including
    the sources file.
