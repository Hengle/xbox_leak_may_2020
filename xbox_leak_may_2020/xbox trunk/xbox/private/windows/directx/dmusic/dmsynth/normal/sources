Module Name:

    sources.

Abstract:

    This file specifies the target component being built and the list of
    sources files needed to build that component.  Also specifies optional
    compiler switches and libraries that are unique for the component being
    built.

    This is for a normal build, so it doesn't define the PROFILE symbol,
    and it uses the $(D) symbol for the library extension. $(D) is going
    to be either blank (for release builds) or 'd' for debug builds.
