To build, you'll need to install LocStudio from:
 \\cptoolzone\Toolbox\LocStudio\Version451a\Release\Disk1\setup.exe

KevinKi pulled this together

LeeHart cobbled this from a series of commands and various makefiles into
        something that more or less builds under build.exe

Once LocStudio is installed, copy .\LocStudio\w32msdev.dll to where LocStudio
was installed (default of %programfiles%\LocStdudio)
