Description
===========
   The Gamepad tool lets you examine the runtime behavior of an Xbox gamepad.
   There are multiple pages to explore different aspects of the gamepad.
   First, there is a control test page, that simply allows the user to view
   values associated with the controls. Next, there is a deadzone calibration
   page, to explore the sensitivity of the thumbstick controls in and around
   the software-defined deadzone. Next, there is a control quantization page
   for seeing which digitized values are actually read from the analog
   controls.
