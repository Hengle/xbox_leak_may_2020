Description
===========
   An XBox port of the DX8 sample stagedpeer.
   

Programming Notes
=================
   This is an extension of XSimplePeer that first displays a multiplayer
staging screen. This screen allows the host of the game to monitor who
wants to enter the game, and then start the game when all players have
joined. During staging, the host can kick players out of the game as well.
