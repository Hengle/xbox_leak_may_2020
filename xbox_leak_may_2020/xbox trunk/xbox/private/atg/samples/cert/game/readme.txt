    * No access of ROMs, SMC, USB, IDE or other off-limits hardware
    * No change of global settings
    * Displays local time-zone adjusted current time
    * Memory unit requirements, including read/write speed, roaming,
      persistence, capacity issues, and dynamic updates
    * Gamer-friendly save game names and default names
    * Game directory limit
    * Title ID, publisher data and game representative image in XE file
    * Game stability
    * Saving to hard drive
    * Rebooting into the Dash for save game management
    * Storage space display requirements
    * Menu buttons and controller navigation
    * In-game pause and resume requirements
    * Controller selection and discovery
    * Loss of controller

    The game is not designed to meet the more subjective non-technical
    gameplay requirements. In other words, the game is not necessarily fun!
