Description
===========
   The SetFilter sample demonstrates how to use the Xbox's programmable filter
block via the SetFilter method on a DirectSound Buffer.  This sample has been
updated with routines to approximate hardware filter coefficients based on
filter cutoff frequency and gain.  These routines are a rough approximation
and will likely be replaced with a lookup table in the near future.
