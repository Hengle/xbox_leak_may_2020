Description
===========
   The Explosion sample demonstrates a way of using ZSprites (see ZSprite
sample) to create an explosion effect.  Typical billboarded explosions suffer
from artifacts at when intersecting with objects, because the billboard is
a simple quad, and so intersects in a line.  Using ZSprites to give depth to 
these billboards, the intersection appears more correct.
   TODO: Replace this with discussion of art generation
   The ZSprite is generated by rendering a simple sphere into the 2 textures
which we are using for our image texture and depth map.  When generating 
ZSprite texture pairs in this way, the goal is to set up the projection 
transform such that the object takes up as much of the frustum as possible,
in order to keep depth resolution.

Programming Notes
=================
   ZSprite texture can be made in a variety of ways:
   * Rendering into 2 textures:
        Set up your transforms such that the objects to be rendered fill as
        much of the frustum as possible.  Set one texture as the render
        target and another (made to look like a depth/stencil surface) as
        the depth/stencil target.  Render into these textures, then use the
        top 16 bits of depth from the depth texture as your z values.
   * Rendering sideways:
        Render the objects head-on into the image texture.  Then, rotate the
        objects sideways, and render against a gradient background; render
        one slice, back-to-front, for each column of the depth texture.
   * Render with fog:
        Render the objects head-on into the image texture.  Then, make the 
        objects all-white or all-black, and set linear fog to the other 
        color.  Render this into the depth texture.  

   Note that the 2nd and 3rd methods only yield 8 bits of depth precision.
Depending on how large the ZSprites will be scaled, this may or may not be
a problem.
