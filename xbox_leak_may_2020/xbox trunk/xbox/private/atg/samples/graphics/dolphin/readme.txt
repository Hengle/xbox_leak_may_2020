Description
===========
   The Dolphin sample shows an underwater scene of a dolphin swimming, with
   caustic effects on the dolphin and seafloor. The dolphin is animated using
   a technique called "tweening". The underwater effect simply uses fog, and
   the water caustics use an animated set of textures.

Programming Notes
=================
   Several things are happening in this sample. First of all is the use of 
   fog to give an underwater effect. The fog parameters are set up in the 
   InitDeviceObjects() function.

   The water caustics are achieved by animating a set of 32 different textures
   (caust00.tga through caust31.tga). The caustics can be blending into the
   scene using multitexturing or multi-pass blending techniques. It is
   straightforward except for one tricky situation. Since the bottom of the 
   dolphin should not have caustic effects, a separate pass is done where 
   ambient light is removed and the dolphin is lit from above, and then
   blending the diffuse color with the caustic texture.

   The dolphin is animated using a technique called "tweening", in which the
   dolphin model's vertices are linearly blending from multiple other sets of
   vertices. The source models for these other sets of vertices is loaded
   from geometry files of the dolphin model in three different positions. Each
   set of vertices is passed down to the vertex shader in a separate stream.
   Each frame, a destination mesh is generated by blending some combination of
   the positions and normals from these meshes together.
