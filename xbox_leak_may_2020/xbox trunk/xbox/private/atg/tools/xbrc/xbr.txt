XBR Compiled Resources

Currently xbrc writes out a set of structures that are interpreted in
xbview.  Eventually, xbrc should write out pushbuffers for the graphic
command procedures and C-code for the expressions and animations.

The standard D3DResources are written out as in .xpr files, as
memory copies of the D3D structures.

See effect.h and anim.h for the file format.

See the xbview sample for how these structures are interpreted. In
particular, see xbr.cpp (which is is not at optimal and will change,
but at least shows a starting point.)
