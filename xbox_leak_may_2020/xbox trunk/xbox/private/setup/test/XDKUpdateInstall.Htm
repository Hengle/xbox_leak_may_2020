<H3><A NAME="4."></A>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xbox Development System Setup</H3>

<P>The development system is the computer that runs the Microsoft&#174; Visual C++&#174; compiler and is where the Xbox SDK must be installed. Installing the latest version of the SDK is the only step required on the development system for the April 2001 XDK release, as long as the development system meets the requirements for the February 2001 release (Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; 2000 with Service Pack 1 and Visual C++ with Service Pack 4 and the Processor Pack).</P>

<P class=note><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Code written to run on the Xbox System Software must be run and tested only on the XDK target system provided by Microsoft. Do not run code written for Xbox on a development system or any system other than the target system.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.1"></A>4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SDK Installation</H4>
<P>Before you can install the XDK software on Windows 2000, you must have permissions at the level of Administrator. Refer to the Windows help system for further information.</P>

<P>It is not necessary to uninstall a prior release of the Xbox SDK before installing this update.  If you do not have a prior release of the Xbox SDK installed, first perform the steps in section <A HREF="#4.2"><B>4.2</B></A> below.</P>

<P>Install the Xbox SDK from the April 2001 SDK disc. To install, insert the disc into your development system CD drive, select <B>Install Xbox SDK - April 2001</B> from the installation screen, and follow the instructions.</P>

<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the installation program copies an updated file to the SDK directory on your hard disk, it will overwrite the existing file even if that file has been modified by you since the last SDK install.  For example, if you have made changes to the sample or tutorial code installed with a previous SDK, but left those modified files in the same location and with the same filename, the update will overwrite those files with new versions and you will lose any changes you might have made.  Copy any modified files you wish to retain to a new location prior to installing the SDK.</P>

<H4><A NAME="4.2"></A>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Prior SDK Installed</H4>

<P>If you do not have a prior release of the Xbox SDK installed, follow these instructions before downloading and running the SDK update:</P>

<OL>

<LI><P>Your development system must be running Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.  If you have not already done so, upgrade your development system to Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1 (SP1 is downloadable from <A href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/recommended/sp1/default.asp"><B>www.microsoft.com/windows2000/downloads/recommended/sp1/default.asp</B></A>). For installation instructions, see the Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 documentation. Windows 2000 with Service Pack 1 is the only operating system supported by the Xbox Development Kit.</P></LI>

<LI><P>Install Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Professional. For installation instructions, see the Visual C++ documentation.  This step is not necessary if a licensed copy of Visual C++ 6.0 is already installed on the development system. </P></LI>

<LI><P>Install Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 4 from the Service Pack 4 disc included with the XDK.  The install program runs automatically when the disc is inserted into the development system CD drive. To install, follow the instructions on the screen. It is not necessary to install Visual C++ Service Pack 3.</P>

<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Service Pack 4 does not include an uninstall utility. If you want to uninstall Service Pack 4, you must uninstall and reinstall Visual C++ 6.0.</P>
</LI>
  
<LI><P>Install the final version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Processor Pack from the April 2001 SDK disc. To install, insert the disc into your development system CD drive, select <B>Install Visual C++ Processor Pack</B> from the installation screen, and follow the instructions (the Processor Pack is located in the VCPP directory on the disc).  If an earlier version of the Processor Pack is installed, setup will fail with an error that is the same as the error you would receive if you did not have Windows 2000 Service Pack 1, Visual C++ Service Pack 4, or the Visual C++ Processor Pack installed.</P>
</LI>
</OL>

<H3><A NAME="5."></A>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xbox Target System Setup</H3>
<P>The target system is the silver computer that came with the XDK; it is configured to represent the Xbox video game console.</P>


<A NAME="5.1"></A><H4>5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Installing the Updated Xbox System Software on the Target System</H4>

<P>Installing the latest version of Xbox System Software is the only step required on the target system for the April 2001 XDK release, provided you have already properly configured the target system hardware you received with earlier versions of the XDK.</P>

<P>The April 2001 release of the XDK includes an updated target system recovery disc that contains a new version of the Xbox System Software. To update your target system to the Xbox System Software, boot your target system from the updated target system recovery disc. You will also use this same process if you need to restore the target system hard disk due to corruption.
</P>

<P>To install or recover the updated Xbox System Software:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Insert the updated target system recovery disc in the target system disc drive and reboot the system.</LI> 
<LI>You will be prompted to press any controller button.</LI> 
<LI>After the target system is updated, the disc drive tray will open, and you will be prompted to remove the CD and press any controller button to reboot.</LI> 
<LI>The Title Launcher screen will be displayed in the <B>Settings: Machine Name</B> mode. Enter a name for your target system for network use; select <B>OK</B> when you are finished.</LI> 
</OL>

<P class=note><B>WARNING:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booting from the target system recovery disc will erase the data on the target system hard disk. Copy any data that you wish to retain to another system or storage device before booting from the target system recovery disc.</P>

<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must connect a VGA monitor to the target system while performing the recovery update. After the update is complete, you can reconnect a TV monitor.  See section <A HREF="#7."><B>7</B></A> below.</P>

<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you downloaded the April 2001 XDK Update from the beta support Web site (http://www.betaplace.com) rather than receiving an actual disc from Microsoft, you must burn your own April 2001 XDK recovery disc image using the April_2001.iso file that is available for download on the beta support Web site. For more information about burning a new recovery disc image using April_2001.iso, see the documentation for your CD image burning software (Adaptec Easy CD Creator or similar software). 


<H3><A NAME="6."></A>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Establish a Network Connection Between Target and Development Systems</H3>

<P>If you changed the machine name of the Xbox target system, or you are installing the SDK for the first time on this development system, you must set up the network connection between the target and development systems.  After completing all the steps in <A HREF="#4."><B>Xbox Development System Setup</B></A> and <A HREF="#5."><B>Xbox Target System Setup</B></A>, and with both systems running:</P>

<OL>
<LI>From the development system, click the <B>Start</B> button, click <B>Run</B>, and type &#34;cmd&#34; in the <B>Open:</B> window that appears.</LI>
<LI>From the <B>C:\</B> prompt in the <B>cmd.exe</B> window, type &#34;xbdir -x <I>name</I> xe:\&#34;, where <I>name</I> is the name of your target system entered during the <A HREF="#5.1"><B>Installing the Updated Xbox System Software on the Target System</B></A> step. In place of a name that you assign, you may enter the IP address of the target system (the IP address is displayed at the bottom of the Title Launcher, for example, (123.45.67.89)).</LI>
</OL> 
<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the target system and the development system are not on the same subnet, you must enter the IP address instead of the target system name.</P>
<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If steps 1 and 2 are not accomplished and you attempt to build an Xbox executable, a <B>No address for Xbox has been set</B> compiler error message will result.</P>
<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can use the &#34;xbdir xe:\&#34; command at any time to verify that the two systems are communicating.</P>

<H3><A NAME="7."></A>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connecting a TV</H3>
<P>To create the most accurate run-time environment for testing Xbox games, it is recommended that a TV be used for the Xbox target system monitor. After setting up both systems (sections 4&#8211;6), you may connect a TV. To change the target system display settings, press the <B>X</B> controller button (<B>A</B> on the controllers originally distributed with the XDK) from the Title Launcher screen. You will need to specify the type of television (NTSC or PAL) and the type of cable you are using (S-video or S-video/composite converter, neither of which is included with the XDK). The display settings will not be updated until the target system is rebooted.</P>
<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have changed the display settings such that you can no longer see video from the target system, you can open a command window on the development system and type &#34;xbsetcfg -v MONITOR&#34; to reset the display settings so that the target system will work when connected to a VGA monitor. You will need to reboot the target system after running the &#34;xbsetcfg&#34; command before the display settings change will take effect.</P>

<H3><A NAME="8."></A>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Uninstall the Xbox SDK</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Launch the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> dialog from the Windows Control Panel, select <B>Microsoft Xbox SDK</B>, and then click <B>Change/Remove</B>. </LI>
<LI>Setup will detect the previous installation of the Xbox SDK. Follow the instructions on the screen.</LI> 
</OL>
<P class="note"><B><I>Note</I></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Xbox SDK uninstallation may not delete all files installed with the Xbox SDK. To complete uninstallation in this case, manually delete the Xbox SDK root folder (located at C:\Program Files\Microsoft Xbox SDK, by default).</P>

<P>For uninstallation of Visual C++, see the Visual C++ documentation. You cannot uninstall Visual C++ Service Pack 4 or the Processor Pack separately.</P>

<H3><A NAME="9"></A>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Mode Switching Button Combinations</H3>

<P>When you run the recovery disc it will reset the target system to output to a VGA monitor.  If you do not have a monitor connected, you can use the following button combinations to change the video mode.  It is also possible to change the video mode using the "xbsetcfg" tool, but that requires that your target system is properly set up on the network.  These button combinations can also be used while running the XDK launcher.</P>
