Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

This material has just one submtl, and will multiply the shaded result from that
submtl by the simple param as its result. 

The material itself does no shading - rather, it passes the calls to the submtl and
lets it do it instead. It then takes the shaded result and multiplies by its single
float parameter.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] MtlShade.cpp - all the shading parameters are in here - change the algorithm in 
	Shade(...) to change the appearance of the material.

[] Material.cpp - when adding UI components and new submtls/subtexs, be sure to change
	the reference counts, the amount of subanims and submtls to match.
	Paramblock2 does most of the work with regard to the UI implimentations,
	so don't forget to use it when adding to the UI.
