Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

a radius parameter.

Impliments all the necessities for mesh/custom display, hit testing and bounding
box calculation.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] HelpMesh.cpp - probably the most useful point of change is the whole display 
	system, so that you can customize what the helper actually does.
	Also, if you want to change how the helper is created in the viewports,
	this file is where to start editing. Don't forget - if you change the
	display, you must also update the bounding box and hit-testing calculations
	to match up, or your object will either seem not to exist in the viewport,
	or leave drawing artifacts all over the screen.
