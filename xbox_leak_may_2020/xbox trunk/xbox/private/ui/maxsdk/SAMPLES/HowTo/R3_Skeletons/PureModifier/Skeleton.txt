Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

Impliments a modifier derived from the base class Modifier, implimenting a full
mesh editing capability.

All this skeleton does, however, is add the simple value to every deformable
point in the mesh. However, it does take Soft Selection into account through the use
of the Object class' IsPointSelected and PointSelection methods.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] PureEdit.cpp - contains the vital ModifyObject implimentation that actually edits the 
	mesh in some way. The skeleton shows off how to handle soft selection (as mentioned
	above) and this generic method can be easily applied to all your algorithms.

[] PureModifier.h - contains the definition of the caches that get used and modified by
	the modifier : ChannelsUsed and ChannelsChanged. Don't forget to update them to 
	reflect your algorithm's use of the pipeline information.
