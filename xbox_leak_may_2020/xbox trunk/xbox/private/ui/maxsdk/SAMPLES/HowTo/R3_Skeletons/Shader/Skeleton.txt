Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

The largest plugin skeleton, because even to get simple functionality out of a 
material shader, a lot of support code needs to be written.

This skeleton impliments a basic shading algorithm (Blinn-based), a working UI with
a hilite curve and some basic controls.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] GetSet.cpp - all the variable transactions - need new ones if you add extra parameters.

[] Dialog.cpp - contains all the code to handle the hilite curve, and all the custom
	controls on the dialog panel.

[] Eval.cpp - the main focus of modification, as it contains the shading algorithm and
	the hilite curve calculation.

[] Shader.cpp and Shader.h - set up of all the standard parameters you will use, and 
	all the custom, new parameters you want to set up. Also contains the PB2 definition.
