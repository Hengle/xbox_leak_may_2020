Readme for MXSAgni workspace

This is sample source for creating plugins for MaxScript. All MaxScript functions exposed here are already part of the MaxScript core. You'll see a series of duplicate fn messages printed to MaxScript Listener if a compiled version(mxsagni.dlx) of this plugin is loaded, since all functions declared here already exists. 

For more information on how to exposing functions to MaxScript, refer to MAXScript SDK topic of the MAX SDK help.
