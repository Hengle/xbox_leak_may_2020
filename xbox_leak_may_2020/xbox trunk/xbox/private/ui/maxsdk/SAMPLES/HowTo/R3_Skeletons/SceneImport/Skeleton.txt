Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

A basic scene importer, that impliments a paramaters dialog and configuration 
'manager' that should be portable enough to cope with any custom parameters and variables
you need to display, change and save/load.

This importer works with the Skeleton SceneExporter's files, opens a text editor window
and displays their contents (use of Rich Edit controls)

The file format extension is '.SKEL'

Supports ParamBlock2 : N/A

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] Configuration Manager - change the config filename in ConfigMgr.cpp and customize
	the loading and saving to tie in with your new parameters

[] SceneImport.cpp - change the names of the extensions or the exporter descriptions

[] DoImport.cpp - all the actual import logic is in here, so this is the place to start
	modifying what happens at import time. Also, holds the dialog handler
	for the parameters dialog.
