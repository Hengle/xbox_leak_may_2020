Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] AtmosShade.cpp is where the actual raymarching and shading takes place.
[] Atmospheric.cpp contains code to handle gizmo picking (to make sure they are
	of the right type). It also manages the UI. ParamBlock2 handles 90% of the gizmo
	picking and validation in this case.
