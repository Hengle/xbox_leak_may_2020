Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

This global utility also shows off how to use the viewport overriding capable with 
the new ViewWindow class. This simple example registers a new ViewWindow class
at startup using the global utility mechanism. The view window that is implimented here
is just a simple blank dialog, but handles all the necessary messages to make it work
inside a viewport properly.

Supports ParamBlock2 : N/A

Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] GlobalUtility.cpp - you can change the GUP system to make the plugin behave how
	you wish, but if you just want to use this as a class-registerer
	(as it is now), then this can be left alone.

[] ViewWindow.cpp - change to suit the new viewwindow UI you put in, or remove if you are
	using the GUP registerer to load RC menus, notifications, etc
