Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

An implimentation of a simple object - where the developer is required to fill in
a mesh pointer and pass it back to MAX. 

This skeleton creates a 4 vertex, 2 face plane with UVW mapping, with the plane's 
extents based upon the simple parameter in the UI.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] SimpleMesh.cpp is where the mesh building takes place. It also supports the auto-UVW
	parameter, which should be supported if you can support UVW mapping at object level.
	This file also contians the mouse creation callback, used to determine values for
	your object via the user using the mouse in the viewport. In this example, i take
	the distance between 2 points in space and use that as a 'radius'.
