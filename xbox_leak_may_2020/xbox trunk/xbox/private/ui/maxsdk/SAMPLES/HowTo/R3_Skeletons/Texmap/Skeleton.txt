Description:
____________________________________________________________________________________

Much like the Material skeleton project, this texture map takes in one subtexture, 
evaluates a color result and multiplies it by the simple parameter.

This plugin supports Paramblock2.

Again, like the material, the texture does no shading or major calculation of its own.
All evaluation is passed onto the subtex.

Supports ParamBlock2 : YES

Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] TexShade.cpp - first port of call for changing the texture's algorithm, but if you
	start adding new subtextures and parameters to the UI, don't forget
	to update the number of subtex's in Texmap.h and Texmap.cpp, and update
	the ParamBlock2 definition in Texmap.cpp.
