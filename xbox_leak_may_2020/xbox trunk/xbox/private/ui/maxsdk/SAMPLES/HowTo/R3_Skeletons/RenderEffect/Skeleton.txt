Using this project:
____________________________________________________________________________________

General Customizations:

[] ClassID - change the ID stored in the main header file
[] String Table - change and add to the table to modify the name and variables of the project
[] Dialog Resources - if applicable, change UI to suit your needs
[] Version Resource - change to reflect your name, plugin name and company


Specific Customizations:

[] RenderEffect.cpp - its easy to add items to the UI, because the project uses Paramblock2.
	The primary area for change is the Apply method, that changes
	the supplied 2D bitmap in some way before passing it back to MAX.
	This skeleton only does a very simple effect - darkens every other scanline.
