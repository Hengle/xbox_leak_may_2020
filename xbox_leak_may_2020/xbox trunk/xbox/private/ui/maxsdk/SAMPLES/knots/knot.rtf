\par \pard \qc\widctlpar {\b\fs24 3D Studio MAX Torus Knot Plugin}
\par 
\par \pard \widctlpar This plugin creates objects based on toruses and torus knots with many animatable parameters.  It creates objects by drawing 2D curves in the normal planes around a 3D curve.  The 3D curve (called the {\i Base Curve}
) can either be a circle or a ({\i P,Q}) torus knot.  {\i P} and {\i Q} describe up and down and around-the-center winding numbers.  For
 example a (2,3) torus knot is the classic trefoil knot.  If P and Q are equal, you get a (tilted) torus.  If P and Q are relatively prime, then you get a non-trivial knot.  If P and Q are not relatively prime you get a shape which is deformable into a to
rus.  For the circle base curve, you get to set two parameters Warp Count and Warp Height described below.
\par 
\par The 2D curve (known as the {\i Cross Section}) is a circle with quite a few parameters of its own.
\par 
\par You create a torus knot by selecting \ldblquote Torus Knots\rdblquote  in the object category drop-down list under \ldblquote Geometry\rdblquote  in the object creation panel, and pressing the \ldblquote Knot\rdblquote 
 button.  You then drag out a torus knot in the same
\par way you create a standard torus primitive.
\par 
\par Here is a description of the paramters:
\par {\b     Base Curve:}
\par         Circle\tab \tab Use a circle as a base curve
\par         Torus Knot\tab \tab Use a torus knot as the base curve
\par         Radius\tab \tab Radius of the base curve
\par         Segments\tab \tab The number of mesh vertices around the base curve.
\par         P,Q\tab \tab \tab The winding numbers, only for torus knot base curve.
\par         Warp Count\tab \tab The number of "points" in a star shape around the curve.  Only for the circle base curve.
\par         Warp Height\tab \tab The height of the "points" given as a percentage of the base curve radius.  Only for circle base curves.
\par 
\par {\b     Cross Section:}
\par         Radius\tab \tab The size of the cross section.
\par         Sides\tab \tab The number of mesh vertices around the cross section.
\par         Ecentricity\tab \tab The ratio of the major to minor axes of the cross section.  For making elliptical cross sections (good when used with "twist").
\par         Twist\tab \tab The number of times the cross section twists around the base curve.
\par         Lumps\tab \tab The number of "lumps" around the base curve.
\par         Lump Height\tab \tab The height of the lumps given as a percentage of the radius of the cross section.
\par         Lump Offset\tab \tab The offset of the start of the lumps.  This is for animating the lumps moving.  It is measured in degrees.
\par 
\par {\b     Smooth:}
\par         All\tab \tab \tab Smooth the whole surface.
\par         Sides\tab \tab Smooth adjacent sides.  Good when "Sides" is small to get a polygonal cross section.
\par         None\tab \tab Make the object faceted.
\par 
\par {\b     Texture Coordinates}
\par         Generate Coords\tab When selected the object will get the natural texture coordinates for the surface.
\par         U,V, Offset, Tile\tab Used to adjust the mapper.  U goes around the base curve, and V goes around the cross section.
\par 
\par {\b Sample Files:}
\par         check.max\tab \tab A checkered object with the ecentricity animated.
\par         cruller.max\tab \tab A torus with a twisted cross section.
\par         knot1.max\tab \tab A trefoil knot winds itself into a (3,5) knot.  Then grows lumps.
\par         knot2.max\tab \tab A longer animation showing animation of many  parameters.
\par         knot3.max\tab \tab A twisted trefoil knot with a texture.
\par         lumps.max\tab \tab A strange looking animation.
\par         paddle.max\tab \tab A twisted torus with lots of large paddle-like things sticking out.
\par         pumpko.max\tab \tab A spheroid that animates into a pumpkin-like thing.
\par         ring.max\tab \tab A ring with an interesting scalloped appearance.
\par         star.max \tab \tab A torus as a 5-pointed star with a checkered texture.
