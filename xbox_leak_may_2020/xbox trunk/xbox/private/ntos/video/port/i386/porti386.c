Routine Description:

    This function allows a miniport driver to call the kernel to perform
    an int10 operation.
    This will execute natively the BIOS ROM code on the device.

    THIS FUNCTION IS FOR X86 ONLY.

Arguments:

    HwDeviceExtension - Pointer to the miniport driver's device extension.

    BiosArguments - Pointer to a structure containing the value of the
        basic x86 registers that should be set before calling the BIOS routine.
        0 should be used for unused registers.

Return Value:


Restrictions:

    Device uses IO ports ONLY.

/*++

    VideoPortSetTrappedEmulatorPorts (x86 machines only) allows a miniport
    driver to dynamically change the list of I/O ports that are trapped when
    a VDM is running in full-screen mode. The default set of ports being
    trapped by the miniport driver is defined to be all ports in the
    EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY structure of the miniport driver.
    I/O ports not listed in the EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY structure are
    unavailable to the MS-DOS application.  Accessing those ports causes a
    trap to occur in the system, and the I/O operation to be reflected to a
    user-mode virtual device driver.

    The ports listed in the specified VIDEO_ACCESS_RANGE structure will be
    enabled in the I/O Permission Mask (IOPM) associated with the MS-DOS
    application.  This will enable the MS-DOS application to access those I/O
    ports directly, without having the IO instruction trap and be passed down
    to the miniport trap handling functions (for example EmulatorAccessEntry
    functions) for validation.  However, the subset of critical IO ports must
    always remain trapped for robustness.

    All MS-DOS applications use the same IOPM, and therefore the same set of
    enabled/disabled I/O ports.  Thus, on each switch of application, the
    set of trapped I/O ports is reinitialized to be the default set of ports
    (all ports in the EMULATOR_ACCESS_ENTRY structure).

Arguments:

    HwDeviceExtension - Points to the miniport driver's device extension.

    NumAccessRanges - Specifies the number of entries in the VIDEO_ACCESS_RANGE
        structure specified in AccessRange.

    AccessRange - Points to an array of access ranges (VIDEO_ACCESS_RANGE)
        defining the ports that can be untrapped and accessed directly by
        the MS-DOS application.

Return Value:

    This function returns the final status of the operation.

Environment:

    This routine cannot be called from a miniport routine synchronized with
    VideoPortSynchronizeRoutine or from an ISR.
