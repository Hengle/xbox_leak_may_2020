ISBUILD.EXE OVERVIEW

ISBuild.exe is a command line utility that you can run from the DOS prompt or a batch 
file to build your setup.  ISBuild.exe is located in the folder <InstallShield 
location>\Program. It must be in the same folder as Ide.exe; do not remove ISBuild.exe 
from this location.

Add this directory to your PATH statement before running ISBuild.exe. For example, if 
you have installed InstallShield to the default folder, C:\Program Files\
InstallShield\InstallShield5.5 Professional Edition, you would add the following line 
to your Autoexec.bat file: PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\INSTAL~1\INSTAL~1.1PR\PROGRAM;%PATH%

On Windows NT you would add this value using the Environment tab of the System icon 
in the Control Panel.

When you run ISBuild.exe, you are rebuilding the setup according to the values that 
you supplied in the Media Build Wizard for a specified media name.  That is, before 
you can run ISBuild.exe you must complete the Media Build Wizard.  

When you run the Media Build Wizard and plan to rebuild your setup with ISBuild.exe, 
you cannot specify a new location for the built media files. You must leave it at the 
default setting. Then, when you run ISBuild.exe you can specify an alternate location 
with the -b command-line parameter, described below.

Note:  If you have a large setup that requires a lot of time to build, you can build 
it quickly with the Media Build Wizard before inserting file links into your file 
groups. You can then insert the file links and run ISBuild.exe unattended to build 
the setup.

Command-line parameters

You can override some of the values supplied in the Media Build Wizard by passing the 
command-line parameters listed below to ISBuild.exe. 

Either a slash (/) or a dash (-) must precede the command-line parameters. Separate 
multiple command-line parameters with a space.  But do not put a space inside a 
command-line parameter (for example, -bTest is valid, but not -b Test).

When using long paths and file names, enclose the expressions in double quotation 
marks (for example, ISBuild.exe -b"My Test").  The enclosing double quotation marks 
tell the operating system that spaces within the quotation marks are not to be treated
as delimiters. 

ISBuild.exe command line parameters are not case sensitive; upper- or lowercase 
letters can be used.

Parameter               Description

-m<media name>          The media name that you entered in the Media Build Wizard - 
                        Media Name panel. When specifying a name with a space in it, 
                        enclose the expression in double quotation marks (for example, 
                        "Test Setup").

                        This parameter is required.

-p<project location>	The fully qualified path to the setup project. UNC paths are 
                        acceptable. The root folder of the project is where the .ipr 
                        file resides. For example, if your project is named Setup_1 
                        and it resides in the default location, then Setup_1.ipr might 
                        be located in the following folder:  
                        -p"C:\My Installations\Setup_1"

                        This parameter is required.

	                Because the project (.ipr) file and the project location may 
                        not have identical short file name equivalents, this parameter 
                        should always be specified as a long file name.

-b<path>                The fully qualified path to the folder where you want 
                        the output folders and files to be placed. UNC paths are 
                        acceptable. The built setup's files will be located in 
                        the Disk Images\Disk1 subfolder of the location you specify.

                        This parameter is optional. 

                        If you do not use it, ISBuild.exe will place the output 
                        folders and files in the location specified in the Media 
                        Build Wizard.

-s                      Runs ISBuild.exe in silent mode. The banner, status, and 
                        error messages will not appear at the command prompt. 
      
                        This parameter is optional.

            specify the media name immediately following the -m option. Use double 
            quotation marks for long file names.

Error B5    Unable to load text substitution file %s.

            ISBuild cannot find the text substitution file, which is generated by 
            the IDE, in the project location. Make sure the project location 
            specified is for a valid InstallShield project and you have access rights 
            to that location.

Error B6    Unable to load component definition file %s.

            ISBuild cannot find the component definition files, which are generated 
            by the IDE, in the project location. Make sure the project location 
            specified is for a valid InstallShield project and you have access rights 
            to that location.

Error B7    Unable to load file group definition file %s.

            ISBuild cannot find the file group definition files, which are generated 
            by the IDE, in the project location. Make sure the project location 
            specified is for a valid InstallShield project and you have access rights
            to that location.

Error B8    Unable to load project file %s.

            ISBuild cannot find the project file, which is generated by the IDE, in 
            the project location. Make sure the project location specified is for a 
            valid InstallShield project and you have access rights to that location.

Error B9    Incomplete quote found before -%s parameter.

            An opening or closing quotation mark is missing from a long file name or 
            command-line parameter. Make sure that both opening and closing quotation 
            marks are used properly for long file names and command-line options.

Error B100  Invalid syntax found in the path %s.

            This path is not a valid DOS path or long file name. Make sure that all 
            characters in the path are valid.

Error B101  Path specified, %s, must be relative to the file media library.

            This path is not a relative path or is not relative to the file media 
            library, which is usually located in the Disk1 folder. This error happens 
            when the "Data as files" option is specified in the Media Build Wizard 
            and the CD-ROM Folder property for a component is not a relative path. 
            Do not use a relative path for a component's CD-ROM Folder property.

Error B102  Component, %s, cannot be found.

            This component cannot be found in the file media library. The component 
            definition file may be corrupted or not accessible. Load the project in 
            the IDE and see if all project information is still intact. Try to build 
            the project using the Media Build Wizard.

Error B103  Unable to compress data. Check if the compression exists.

            ISBuild cannot find the compression library or it fails to compress files
            when the Compressed file group property is chosen. If InstallShield is 
            installed properly, you should be able to find the compression library 
            (Zdata*.dll) in the <InstallShield location>\Program folder. If ISBuild 
            fails to compress a certain file, contact technical support and send us 
            that file.

Error B104  Unable to create the folder %s.

            ISBuild is unable to create this folder. Make sure that you have access 
            rights to the folder and it is a valid path.

Error B105  Unable to delete the folder %s.

            ISBuild is unable to delete this folder. Make sure that you have access 
            rights to the folder, the path is valid, and no other application, such 
            as Explorer or DOS, is accessing this folder.

Error B106  Unable to find the folder %s.

            This folder cannot be found or enumerated. This folder may not exist or 
            you don't have access rights to enumerate its contents. Make sure that 
            you have used a valid path to this folder and you have the access rights 
            to enumerate its contents.

Error B107  Source directory string is empty or not found.

            ISBuild cannot find the path to the InstallShield files or user-defined 
            setup files. The path is empty, or it does not exist. Make sure that 
            InstallShield is installed properly and all setup files you inserted into 
            the IDE still exist.

Error B108  Target directory string is empty or not found.

            ISBuild is unable to access the target folder where the built media files 
            are going to be placed. Make sure that you have access rights to the 
            build location.

Error B109  Unable to determine media size.

            ISBuild is unable to determine the size of the media files you are 
            building. The media name specified may not exist or the media definition 
            file may be corrupted. Make sure that the media name you specified has 
            already been built by the Media Build Wizard. Try building it again.

Error B110  Not enough disk space.

            There is not enough disk space to store the built setup. Make sure that 
            you have enough disk space on the drive where you are building the setup.

Error B111  Unable copy file from %s to %s.

            ISBuild is unable to copy a file from the source to the target folder. 
            This error usually occurs when a file in the build location is in use or 
            marked as read-only and cannot be overwritten. Make sure that no file in 
            the build location is in use or marked as read-only.

Error B112  Unable to create file %s.

            ISBuild is unable to create this file in the build location. Make sure 
            that you have access rights to the build location.

Error B113  Unable to load file %s.

            ISBuild is unable to load this file. Make sure that this file exists.

Error B114  Unable to create memory mapping file %s.

            ISBuild is unable to create a memory mapping file for the file media 
            library. Make sure that you have rights to create files in the build 
            location and your system has enough disk space to store the mapping.

Error B115  Unable to find the temporary file %s.

            ISBuild is unable to find a temporary file name for the file media 
            library to be built. Contact technical support.

Error B116  Unable to load a predefined definition file.

            ISBuild is unable to find a predefined file group or component definition
            file. Make sure that InstallShield is installed properly and ISBuild is 
            in the <InstallShield location>\Program folder. Try using the full path 
            in front of ISBuild.

Error B117  Unable to open file %s.

            ISBuild is unable to open this file. Make sure that you have full access 
            right to the location. If this file is a source file, make sure that no 
            other user is modifying the file. If it is a target file, make sure that 
            this file is marked as read-only and you have the rights to modify this 
            file.

Error B119  Unable to find the default language.

            ISBuild is unable to find the language specified. Make sure that 
            InstallShield is installed properly and ISBuild is in the <InstallShield 
            location>\Program folder. Try using the full path in front of ISBuild.

Error B120  Media size is not large enough to store all the data.

            The media size you specified is not large enough to store the setup files 
            inserted into the Setup Files pane of the IDE. InstallShield needs disk 
            space in the Disk1 folder to store information about files, paths, 
            components, file groups, setup types, and so on, in Data1.cab. This error 
            usually occurs when too much information needs to be stored, and a small 
            media size, such as 1.44 MB, is specified. 

            Try to reduce in size or remove some of the files that you inserted into 
            the Setup Files pane of the IDE. Make sure that your setup files are in 
            the <target language>\<target platform> folders so that they will be 
            compressed by ISBuild. Or you can select a larger media size, such as a 
            CD-ROM.

Error B121  Unable to rename the backup folder.

            ISBuild is unable to restore the backup folder back to Disk Images after 
            the build failed. ISBuild always backs up the existing Disk Images folder 
            to bldback before performing a new build. If the new build succeeded, the 
            backup folder is deleted. If the new build failed, the backup folder is 
            renamed. You can manually delete the current Disk Images folder and 
            rename bldback back to Disk Images.

Error B122  Unable to convert file date/time.

            ISBuild is unable to convert the local date/time of the source files to 
            the DOS date/time format. Contact technical support and send us the file.

Error B123  Program is terminated by the user.

            The build process is terminated by you or another application. If it is 
            not intentional, contact technical support.

COMMAND LINE COMPILER

In addition to the integrated compiler, which is executed from the InstallShield IDE,
InstallShield includes a command line compiler that can be invoked from the DOS 
prompt or from a DOS batch file. This utility, called Compile.exe, is located in the 
InstallShield Program directory. 

Once a setup project has been completely defined, Compile.exe can be used together 
with ISbuild.exe, a command line media builder, to create a setup media image without 
starting the InstallShield IDE. 

Syntax

Compile script_file [ ins_file ] [ switches ]

Parameters

script_file

Specifies the name of the setup script. This filename can include a drive designation 
and path. Normally, the filename will be setup.rul.

ins_file

Specifies the filename to assign to the compiled script. If this parameter is not 
specified, the output file is given the name of the script file and the extenstion 
.ins.

Switches

The following optional switches can be passed to the compiler:

/d or -d     Defines a constant.  This switch must be followed by an expression in 
             the following format: identifier=value

             The identifier must be a valid InstallScript identifier; the value must 
             be a constant. No space is permitted between the switch and the 
             expression or within the expression. 

/e or -e     Specifies the maximum number of error messages. The default value is 50. When the maximum number of error messages have been generated, compilation stops.

/g or -g     Specifies that a debug file should be produced. This file is given the 
             name of the setup and extension .dbg.

/i or -i     Specifies a path to the location of script files that are included in 
             the compile.

/n or -n     Disables CRC checking on the .ins file. When CRC checking is enabled, 
             the .ins file is tested at run time and if found to be corrupt, the 
             setup is aborted and an error message is displayed. CRC checking is 
             enabled by default.

/v or -v     Sets the warning level to one of the following values:

             0   Displays no warning messages.

             1   Displays any system warning message that InstallShield is unable to 
                 handle.

             2   Displays Level 1 messages, plus a message if string length exceeds 
                 the limit.

             3   Displays all warning messages. This is the default.

/w or -w     Specifies the maximum number of warning messages. The default value is 
             50. When the maximum number of warning messages have been generated, 
             compilation stops.

Comments

Unless you are logged to the InstallShield Program directory, you must either use the 
DOS PATH command to place the InstallShield Program directory in the DOS search path 
before invoking the compiler or specify the fully-qualified name of the compiler in 
the DOS command. 

When specifying filenames, you can use either short or long filenames; however, long 
filenames must be enclosed within double quotation marks.

Examples

The following command line compiles the script setup.rul that is located in the 
"C:\My Installations\Test Pad\Script Files" folder. Because this script uses Sd 
dialogs, the switch -I is used to indicate the location of the Sd dialog support 
files. 

Compile -I"C:\Program Files\InstallShield\InstallShield 5.0 Professional Edition\
Include" "C:\My Installations\Test Pad\Script Files\Setup.rul"
