Welcome to the Demo Project for DirectMusic Producer, DirectX 8 version.  

This project is designed to be a teaching tool to aid in familiarizing users with some 
basic techniques that are available in DirectMusic. 

It is recommended that you set your screen resolution to 1024 X 768 for the purposes of this
project only.  

It is recommended that you audition this project with the default synth, the Microsoft 
Synthesizer.  While other synths can be used, they may not support all the features of 
DirectX 8, e.g., audiopaths and effects.  This Demo Project does not require you to set up 
specific ports (any pchannel should be supported).  Number of voices allocated is set to 128 
by default.  This can be edited by right clicking the MIDI/Performance Options button in the 
Transport Options toolbar.  

The Project is organized into bookmarks.  Bookmarks are very helpful in retaining window 
settings for demo or authoring purposes. Notice the Go to Bookmark dropdown list; it's next 
to the little flag icon.  Progress through the bookmarks in order to experience this Demo 
Project.  

You'll recognize the first 33 bookmarks, as they are from DirectX7.  DX8 examples start at 
bookmark 34.  

The files referenced by bookmarks 43-46 are provided by Sonic Implants.  For more DLS sounds 
go to www.sonicimplants.com.   

Have fun; use these modest little examples as starting points for experimentation. We hope 
you can envision some variable and interactive possibilities for your music.
