	(a)	Microsoft grants to Recipient a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to make and use up to three (3) copies of the executable code of the Software CPUs located on Recipient’s premises at the address provided below, only for the purpose of developing and testing prerelease versions of computer software applications, and to provide feedback thereon to Microsoft.  Recipient must acquire the final commercial release of the DirectX in order to develop and distribute versions of Recipient’s computer software applications which operate with the final commercial release of DirectX.  Development and distribution of such computer software applications shall be governed by the license agreement accompanying the final commercial release of the DirectX.  Recipient 
acknowledges that Microsoft will not be obligated to make the Software available as a final commercial product. All other rights are reserved to Microsoft.  Recipient shall not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, assign, or otherwise transfer the Software, including any accompanying printed materials.

Microsoft and its suppliers shall retain title and all ownership rights to the Software.

	(b)	Recipient agrees to provide reasonable feedback to Microsoft, including but not limited to usability, bug reports, and test results, with respect to the Software testing.  Recipient will use reasonable efforts to review and comment on all documentation supplied. All bug reports, test results, and other feedback made by Recipient shall be the property of Microsoft and may be used by Microsoft for any purpose.  Due to the nature of the development work, Microsoft is not certain as to when errors or discrepancies in the Software may be corrected.

	(c)	Recipient may disclose the Software only to its employees who have a need to know in order to accomplish the purposes identified in Section 1(a) and such employees’ use of the Software shall take place solely at Recipient’s site.  Recipient will have executed appropriate written agreements with its employees sufficient to enable it to comply with the terms of this Agreement.

4.	PRODUCT MAINTENANCE.   Microsoft is not obligated to provide maintenance, technical support or updates to Recipient for Software licensed pursuant to this Agreement.  However, Microsoft may, in its sole discretion, provide further pre-release versions, technical support, updates and/or supplements of any Software and/or related information (“Updates”) to Recipient hereunder, in which case such Updates shall also be deemed to be included in the Software, and therefore governed by this Agreement, unless other terms of use are provided by Microsoft with such Updates. In no event shall Microsoft be obligated to provide Recipient, free of charge, a copy of the commercial release version of the Software in connection with Recipient’s participation in the testing program.  Microsoft is not obligated to make any Software commercially available.

5.	CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Software and related information is proprietary and confidential information to Microsoft and its suppliers.  Recipient agrees not to disclose or provide the Software, documentation, or any related information (including the Software features or the results of use or testing) to any third party or use the Software for any purpose other than as provided in  this Agreement.  However, Recipient may disclose confidential information in accordance with judicial or other governmental order, provided Recipient shall give Microsoft reasonable written notice prior to such disclosure and shall comply with any applicable protective order or equivalent.  Further, Recipient shall not be obligated to maintain the confidentiality of information which Recipient can prove (i) is already known to Recipient without an obligation to maintain the same as confidential; (ii) becomes publicly known through no wrongful act of Recipient; (iii) is rightfully received from a third party without breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Microsoft; or (iv) is independently developed by Recipient.  This provision shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement with respect to any information that has not been made public by Microsoft as of the commercial release of the Software.

6.	INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  All title and intellectual property rights in and to the Software (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video, audio, music, text and “applets’ incorporated into the Software), and any copies Recipient is permitted to make herein are owned by Microsoft or its suppliers. All title and intellectual property rights in and to the content which may be accessed through use of the Software are the property of the respective content owner and may be protected by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.

Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply to Recipient.

9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES.  Notwithstanding any damages that Recipient might incur for any reason whatsoever (including, without limitation, all damages referenced above and all direct or general damages), the entire liability of Microsoft and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and Recipient’s exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by Recipient for the Software or Five Dollars (US$5.00).

10.	GOVERNING LAW; ATTORNEYS FEES.   This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws of the State of Washington, and Recipient consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in King County, Washington, unless no federal jurisdiction exists, in which case Recipient consents to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington.  Recipient waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens.  Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.
