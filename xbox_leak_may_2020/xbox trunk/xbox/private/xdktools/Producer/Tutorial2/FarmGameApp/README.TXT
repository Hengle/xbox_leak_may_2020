Description
===========
  The DirectMusic Farm Demo audio player is designed to test your
  DirectMusic score in the context of a simple application. The audio 
  player can be found in the FarmGameApp folder. Double-click Farm.exe
  or click Start, click Run, and then enter the path to Farm.exe to
  open the player.   

  The Farm Demo demonstrates how an application and a DirectMusic 
  script work together. The script reads and writes to variables in the 
  application, and the application calls routines in the script that 
  play segments.

  The sample also demonstrates how waves can be played as variations 
  in a segment.


User's Guide
============
  You can play the sound effects and secondary segment at any time.
  After you start a background, you can play the end. Click the All 
  Stop button if you want the current background segment to stop 
  immediately.
