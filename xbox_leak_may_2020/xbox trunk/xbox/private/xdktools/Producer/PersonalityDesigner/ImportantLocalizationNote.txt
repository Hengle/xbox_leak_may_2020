Important undo/redo information is coded in the undo/redo strings.  It is translation invariant provided you adhere to the following rules:

1. The first word in an IDS_UNDO_XXXX string is the header (the word before the colon).  You must keep it as the first word of the undo string.
If you translate it you must also provide the identical translation for the corresponding word in one or more of the following single word resources:

IDS_PERSONALITYUNDO_HEADER
IDS_CHORDMAPUNDO_HEADER
IDS_SIGNPOSTUNDO_HEADER

2. If you translate any of the words in the body of an IDS_UNDO_XXXX that matches the word in one of the following single word resources,
you must also provide the indentical translation for the corresponding word in one or more of the following single word resources:

IDS_DELETE_UNDO
IDS_INSERT_UNDO
IDS_PASTE_UNDO
IDS_CUT_UNDO

Note that except for the header (see rule 1) you don't have to maintain the same word order in the undo/redo string translation.

3.  You must do the same for the IDS_UNDO_XXX strings in the ChordMapStripMgr project which have matches for the strings listed in items 1 and 2 above.
