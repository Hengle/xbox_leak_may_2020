delete XboxSDK\, XboxSDK.iso, and XDKSetup*.exe from XBLD_PVT\_BUILDVER\

from Fre Razzle
sync as necessary
"dailyFre -lq buildSDK"

"dailyFre -lq buildSDK -t" will test sdksetup for missing files
check the bottom of XBLD_LOG for errors

close the razzle window before trying to move the build to release

[ready to release]
move latest.txt and _BUILDVER\ from XBLD_PVT to XBLD_REL

[run BVTs]
copy XBLD_PVT\_BUILDVER\checked\recovery.iso to machine with burner
burn recovery.iso using CD-RW
run recovery
\\xstress\stress\stress.exe

debugger version to %TEMP% and open it.
"prepbvt.cmd 1 -x <ip addr of xbox>" will copy the harness, test media,
and testini to xbox, and start bvts.
when harness is done, "getresults.cmd 1 -x <ip addr of xbox>" will copy
test logs from the xbox to _BUILDVER\checked\results

the "1" in prepbvt and getresults refers to testing a checked build
if testing free, use a "3" instead.
